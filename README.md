# Spam Detector Project

## Purpose
This project aims to classify email data into spam and non-spam categories using Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.

## Methods
- Data preprocessing: Handled missing data, balanced label distribution, and scaled features.
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest models were trained and evaluated.
- Accuracy comparison was performed to determine the better-performing model.

## Results
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: [Logistic Regression Accuracy Value]
- Random Forest Accuracy: [Random Forest Accuracy Value]
- Conclusion: [Random Forest or Logistic Regression] performed better.
